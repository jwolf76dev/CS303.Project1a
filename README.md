# CS303.Project1a
Kati Williams, Binh Mai, and Jay Wolf

This project was a collaborative group effort for CS 303 project 1.

This point of this code is to create an assignment tracker. There are two lists which hold assignments: the assigned list and the completed/late list. The lists are arranged in order by their due date (using Date.h->Date class). Lists can be manipulated by a series of options which are prompted in the form of a text based menu.

Build notes: None.

All C++ code was written, compiled, and tested in Visual Studio 2015
